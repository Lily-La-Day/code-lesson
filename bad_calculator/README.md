# Bad Calculator

 ##### This code is not very good. Your job is to make it better.

Over the next few sessions you will learn some foundational coding concepts that you will then be able to apply to this calculator to make it better.

### Lesson One

We won't push ourselves here. Lesson one will be focussed on getting set-up. We will be working with Ruby and you will need to understand how to do this. You will also need to know how to work from the code that I have written and stored here (on GitHub).

First steps:
- Create a GitHub account
- Fork this repo
- `brew install Ruby`
- Run this code and use the bad calculator

From this point we will be in a position to go on to look at how the calculator works.

We will discuss:
- Variables and Data Types
- String interpolation


Your task will be to:

 #####  Add a step to the bad calculator that will allow us to add one more operation and one more number.

You will need to make this change and push it to GitHub, you will then create your first Pull Request. I will review your code and if there are changes to be made this will be homework. Before the next lesson your branch will be merged into this branch.


In future lessons you will refactor the calculator completely, you will implement:

- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Error Handling

By then end, we may even be able to rename the file.
